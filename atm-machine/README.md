# ATM MACHINE
In this project, the objective was to design a system that can simulate the operation of an ATM machine.
## Technologies
- Environment: `Windows 10 64-bit`
- Intepreter: `Python 3.10`
## Files
This project contains the following files:
|Filename| Description|
|:--------|------------|
|atmcode.py| the code that controls the operation of the whole system|
|bankinfo.json| JSON file that stores all metadata related to the users of the system|

## Features
Some of the features implemented in this system are;
-  Withdrawal
-  Deposit
-  Check balance
-  Transfer money
-  Receipts

- I used a json file to store the users information because that way it's easier to read and update the values.
